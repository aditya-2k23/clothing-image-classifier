# Clothing Image Classifier

This repository contains machine learning models to classify clothing images into various categories. The models are trained and evaluated using a dataset of labeled clothing images. We are using the [Fashion-MNIST](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) dataset (clothing images) for this purpose.

## Models Implemented

1. [Logistic Regression](LogisticRegression.ipynb)
2. [Random Forest Classifier](RandomForest.ipynb)
3. [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](CNN.ipynb)

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Problem Statement and Objective

To classify each 28×28 grayscale image into 1 of 10 garment categories (t-shirt, trouser, pullover, etc.). In general, the model learns from labeled images (training set) and predicts classes on new images (test set).
